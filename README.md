# Power_BI-Parch_and_Posey_Sales_Data


Interactive visualization of the sales data of a paper company to analyze the performance of sales over a period of time.

## First Edit

The dashboard has been adjusted so that it can be viewed as one or more of the following:

* West manager
* Midwest manager
* Northeast manager
* West manager

A slicer for the timeline has also been added.


## Second Edit

The accounts and region table was denormalised with SQL JOIN so that a star schmea can be generated for the data model.

The SQL file can be found in the repository.

Calculated columns for the unit cost of standard, poster and gloss paper were added using DAX.
