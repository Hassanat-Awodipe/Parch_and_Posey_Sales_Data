## Edit 1

The dashboard has been adjusted so that it can be viewed as one or more of the following:

* West manager
* Midwest manager
* Northeast manager
* West manager

A slicer for the timeline has also been added.


## Edit 2

The accounts and region table was denormalised with SQL JOIN so that a star schmea can be generated for the data model. The new accounts table was downloaded as a CSV file.

The SQL code and the CSV file can be found in the repository. 

Calculated columns for the unit cost of standard, poster and gloss paper were added using DAX.


## Edit 3

Imported data from Postgres database.
